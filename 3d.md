# Projeciton matrix
- coordinates are 3d
- the problem of 3d is converting 3d coordinates to 2d

- objects that are far away appear smaller
- objects that are close appear bigger
=> there is 'scale(z) -> float' and x and y are multiplied by this scale

| model matrix is to place objects into world
| view matrix is for camera movement
| projection is for projecting 3d to 2d
